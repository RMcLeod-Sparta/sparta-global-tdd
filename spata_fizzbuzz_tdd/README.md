# FizzBuzz TDD

## Deliverables

* Must be OOP
* Must be developed TDD approach
* Must be testable
* Must have README.md with instructions on how to run the code

## "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”

## Instructions

Open the terminal and go to the "sparta_fizzbuzz_tdd" folder.
While immediately inside the sparta_fizzbuzz_tdd folder run the rspec command to
have the program print the numbers from 1 to 100 appropriately with the test case
results of the expected results of the numbers 3,5,15 and 67.

You can also run the "ruby fizzbuzz_engine.rb" command inside the lib folder to
get just a print out of the numbers, Fizz's, Buzz's and FizzBuzz's.

## Test Driven Development

Testing 3,5,15 and 67 shows all expect values types of outputs we expect to get
i.e. Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz and an appropriate numerical value. These test cases
were set up before writing the code to define the expected results. I did this
so I could continually test the code I had written and facilitate TDD.
